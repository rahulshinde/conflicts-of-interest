He has led scout camps in Ukraine, Germany, Canada, and across the United States. His professional engagements center on public land advocacy, community development, and outdoor recreation.

how_we_met: Zan and our mutual friend Chelsea used to have these gatherings called PP Party at their house in South Philly back when we gathered inside/in person/in groups, and I distinctly remember a performance given by Zan last winter at the foot of the staircase that was one of the best readings of a poem Iâ€™d heard. Me and Wilmer used to drink fancy cocktails Zan made at a bar downtown, which I miss.
