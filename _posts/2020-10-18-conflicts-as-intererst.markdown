how_we_met: Zan and our mutual friend Chelsea used to have these gatherings called PP Party at their house in South Philly back when we gathered inside/in person/in groups, and I distinctly remember a performance given by Zan last winter at the foot of the staircase that was one of the best readings of a poem I’d heard. Me and Wilmer used to drink fancy cocktails Zan made at a bar downtown, which I miss.

**SKILLMAN**  
<br>
our first house was a chicken coop  
a tarpaper shack with no insulation  
there was no other place to live
<br>  
across the pasture grandma  
decorates the outhouse  
with fashion catalogs

**PHILADELPHIA**  
<br>
the city sprouts between rivers  
geometric  
like fungus after rain  
<br>
I stroll the streets among strangers  
buildings  
high and low  
<br>  
I hide my soul  
because my shadow is automatic

**LIKE A MONADNOCK**  
<br>
a man stands alone  
ambles, relocates  
I am him, he is me  
a grain of salt shy  
from dissolve  
like a monadnock

**MANNEQUINS**  
<br>
in a storefront  
of the famous or well-known strip  
stands a woman  
two, to bring back your attention  
mannequin  
mannequin  
<br>
mannequins  

**SILHOUETTE**  
<br>
to overcome the problem  
of the moon’s radiance  
my silhouette  
<br>
I move, it moves  
I turn, it turns  
I stop, it stops  
I dance, we dance  
<br>
then, from a hidden corner of my body  
an unknown figure submits  
and I detach
