about_author: Connie Yu practices writing, performance, printing, and cooking in Philadelphia. They are a cofounder and otherwise tender to the queer Asian print collective FORTUNE.

how_we_met: Out of these contributors, I think I’ve known Connie the longest. We went to school together, and since then I’ve admired their quiet ferocity and intense intelligence and kindness. Connie was one of the first people I videochatted with in the pandemic, in March—along with mutual friends, we worked on the New York Times Sunday crossword.
