about_author: ✅ art, mostly visionary; sometimes i moonlight as a scholar<br>✅ i have never taken a properly focused photograph in my entire life<br>✅ orthodoxy is a luxury we cannot afford

how_we_met: The last thing I texted Wilmer was a video of me skateboarding, badly, in an empty parking lot. The last thing Wilmer texted me was about puzzles, which we did a lot of collaboratively last winter. We’ve also collaborated on book projects, art, partnership, cooking, foraging, and so on. Wilmer’s one of my oldest friends.
