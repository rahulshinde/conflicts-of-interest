how_we_met: I remember when I first moved to New York, I used to run into Gee all the time. At first it was surprising to me, but then it made sense – Gee’s kindness makes you feel at home wherever you are. Gee is razor-sharp and someone who makes me feel excited about the possibilities of publication as form.
